# README vs Reality: What's Missing

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Installing Dependencies

| What README Says | What Actually Happens | What You Need to Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | ❌ FAILS on adam-atan2 with `TypeError: canonicalize_version()` | Install all packages EXCEPT adam-atan2, create local workaround |

### FlashAttention

| What README Says | What Actually Happens | What You Need to Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| "Install FlashAttention 3 for Hopper" | ❌ Import errors crash training | Modify layers.py with fallback implementation |
| "Install FlashAttention 2 for Ampere" | ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flash_attn'` | Add HAS_FLASH_ATTN flag and standard_attention() |

### Running Training

| What README Says | What Actually Happens | What You Need to Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 python pretrain.py` | ❌ No dataset exists | Build dataset FIRST with build_sudoku_dataset.py |
| Uses default config | ❌ Torch compile errors | Add `DISABLE_COMPILE=1` |
| `global_batch_size=384` | ❌ May cause OOM | Reduce to 128 or 64 |

### Dataset Preparation

| What README Says | What Actually Happens | What You Need to Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Shows dataset commands | ✅ Commands work | BUT must run BEFORE training (not emphasized) |
| "Download and build" | Takes 20-30 minutes | Plan accordingly |

### Expected Runtime

| What README Says | What Actually Happens | What You Need to Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| "~10 hours on RTX 4070" | ✅ Accurate | Use screen/tmux for long runs |
| "~10 minutes on 8 GPUs" | Untested | Single GPU more realistic |

## Missing Critical Information

### 1. Error Handling
README doesn't mention:
- adam-atan2 installation will fail
- FlashAttention might not be available
- Torch compilation issues with Dynamo
- Tensor stride/view errors

### 2. Required Workarounds
README doesn't provide:
- Fallback for adam-atan2
- Fallback for FlashAttention
- DISABLE_COMPILE flag necessity
- .contiguous() fixes for tensor operations

### 3. Practical Considerations
README doesn't explain:
- Build dataset BEFORE training
- Training takes HOURS (plan accordingly)
- Use screen/tmux for long runs
- Monitor with nvidia-smi and htop

## Code Sections That Needed Fixes

### 1. Optimizer Import (pretrain.py line 19)
```python
# README assumes this works:
from adam_atan2 import AdamATan2  

# Reality: Package broken, need local file
```

### 2. Attention Mechanism (layers.py lines 130-136)
```python
# README assumes FlashAttention installed:
attn_output = flash_attn_func(q=query, k=key, v=value, causal=self.causal)

# Reality: Need fallback implementation
```

### 3. Training Launch
```bash
# README command:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 python pretrain.py

# Working command:
DISABLE_COMPILE=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 python3 pretrain.py \
  data_path=data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000 \
  [multiple required parameters]
```

## Documentation Gaps

### What Should Have Been Included:

1. **Troubleshooting Section**
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Dependency issues
   - Memory problems

2. **Compatibility Matrix**
   - Python versions tested
   - PyTorch versions
   - CUDA requirements
   - GPU memory needs

3. **Fallback Implementations**
   - What to do without FlashAttention
   - Alternative optimizers
   - CPU-only training

4. **Realistic Expectations**
   - Actual training times
   - Memory requirements
   - Success metrics

## Files Created/Modified for Workarounds

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| adam_atan2.py | Created | Replace broken package |
| models/layers.py | Modified (3 places) | Add attention fallback |
| Environment | Modified | Add DISABLE_COMPILE=1 |
| Training params | Modified | Adjust batch size, LR |

## Verification the README Should Include

```bash
# After dependencies:
python3 -c "from adam_atan2 import AdamATan2; print('✓ Optimizer working')"

# After dataset build:
ls data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000/train/*.npy | wc -l

# During training:
ps aux | grep pretrain.py
nvidia-smi
```

## Summary

The README presents an idealized installation that:
- ✅ Works perfectly IF all stars align
- ❌ Fails immediately in practice
- ❌ Provides no troubleshooting
- ❌ Missing 5+ critical workarounds

This is common in research code where:
- Authors have specific environments
- Dependencies change over time  
- Edge cases aren't documented
- "Works on my machine" syndrome

**Bottom Line**: The code IS legitimate and DOES work, but requires significant debugging and workarounds not documented in the README.
