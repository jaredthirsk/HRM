# AdamATan2 Optimizer Investigation

## Summary

The HRM project uses AdamATan2, a novel optimizer from Google DeepMind (2024) that replaces division with `atan2` for better numerical stability. However, the package installation fails due to setuptools and CUDA compilation issues.

2. **investigation-log.md** - Timeline of discovery and debugging
3. **implementation-comparison.md** - Side-by-side code comparison of all versions

## Quick Facts

### The Problem
- `pip install adam-atan2` fails with setuptools error
- Package requires CUDA compilation with exact version match
- No pre-built wheels available

### Our Solution
1. Created simple workaround using standard Adam (got training running)
2. Investigated the real algorithm from source code
3. Implemented proper Python version of AdamATan2

### Impact on Training
- **Current**: Using standard Adam disguised as AdamATan2
- **Effect**: Training works fine, slightly suboptimal
- **Risk**: May need minor hyperparameter adjustments

## The Three Implementations

| Version | Location | Algorithm | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Original CUDA | adam-atan2 package | atan2-based | ‚ùå Won't install |
| Simple Workaround | `/exp/HRM/adam_atan2.py` | Standard Adam | ‚úÖ Currently used |
| Proper Python | `/exp/HRM/adam_atan2_proper.py` | atan2-based | ‚úÖ Available |

## What is AdamATan2?

From the paper "Scaling Exponents Across Parameterizations and Optimizers" (arXiv:2407.05872):

**Standard Adam:**
```python
param = param - lr * m / (sqrt(v) + epsilon)
```

**AdamATan2:**
```python
param = param - lr * atan2(m, sqrt(v))
```

Benefits:
- No epsilon hyperparameter needed
- Better numerical stability
- Scale invariance
- Prevents gradient underflow

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
Continue with current workaround - it's working fine.

### For Better Results
```bash
# Use the proper implementation
cp adam_atan2_proper.py adam_atan2.py
```

### For Production
Fix CUDA versions and install the real package:
```bash
# Match PyTorch and system CUDA versions
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install adam-atan2
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Research code is fragile** - Depends on specific environments
2. **Simple workarounds work** - Standard Adam is robust enough
3. **Understanding papers helps** - We could implement the algorithm ourselves
4. **Document compromises** - Future users need to know what changed

## Bottom Line

- Training is working successfully ‚úÖ
- We're using standard Adam instead of AdamATan2 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- This is fine for most purposes üëç
- Proper implementation available if needed üì¶
