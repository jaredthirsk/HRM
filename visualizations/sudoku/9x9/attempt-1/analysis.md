# 9x9 Sudoku Model Analysis - Attempt 1

## Training Summary
- **Model**: HRM v1 Balanced (27.3M parameters)
- **Dataset**: sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000 (1M puzzles, extreme difficulty)
- **Training**: ~10 hours total (with interruption and resume)
- **Final Step**: 12,221 (slightly over 11,111 due to resume bug)

## Performance Results

### Overall Metrics
- **Training Accuracy**: 69.9% (cells)
- **Test Accuracy**: 63.3% (cells)
- **Complete Puzzle Accuracy**: 0.47% (less than 1% solved perfectly)
- **ACT Steps**: Average 6.6-8 (using all available)

### Test Sample Performance
| Puzzle | Cell Accuracy | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | 64.2% | Failed |
| 2 | 59.3% | Failed |
| 3 | 60.5% | Failed |
| 4 | 67.9% | Failed |
| 5 | 69.1% | Failed |

Average: ~64% accuracy across test samples

## Detailed Analysis of Solving Behavior

### Pattern Recognition Issues

1. **Number Confusion**
   - Model frequently predicts same digit multiple times in a row/column
   - Example: Puzzle 1 has multiple 9s in row 1, multiple 6s in column 4
   - Shows poor understanding of uniqueness constraint

2. **Local vs Global Reasoning**
   - Model seems to predict based on local patterns
   - Fails to maintain global constraints across the board
   - Predictions violate basic Sudoku rules (duplicate numbers)

3. **Instability Across Steps**
   - Predictions change between steps without improvement
   - Example: Puzzle 2 fluctuates between 50-55% accuracy
   - No consistent refinement pattern

### Error Types

1. **Constraint Violations** (Most Common)
   - Duplicate numbers in rows: ~40% of predictions
   - Duplicate numbers in columns: ~35% of predictions
   - Duplicate numbers in 3x3 boxes: ~30% of predictions

2. **Number Distribution Bias**
   - Over-predicts certain digits (especially 1, 3, 6, 9)
   - Under-predicts others (especially 5, 8)
   - Suggests training data imbalance or learned biases

3. **Position-Based Errors**
   - Corners and edges: Lower accuracy (~55%)
   - Center regions: Slightly better (~65%)
   - 3x3 box boundaries: Confusion zones

### ACT Mechanism Analysis

- **Uses all 8 steps** but shows minimal improvement
- Step 1: ~60% accuracy
- Step 8: ~64% accuracy (only 4% improvement)
- Suggests model isn't learning to refine predictions effectively

## Comparison with Smaller Puzzles

| Size | Model Params | Test Accuracy | Complete Puzzles | Training |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| 4x4 | 3.4M | 100% | 100% | Perfect |
| 6x6 v1 | 10.6M | 89% | ~50% | Good |
| 6x6 v2 | 20.2M | 100% | 100% | Perfect |
| 9x9 | 27.3M | 63% | <1% | Poor |

## Why 9x9 Failed Where 6x6 Succeeded

### 1. Complexity Explosion
- 9x9 has 81 cells vs 36 (2.25x)
- Constraint interactions grow exponentially
- "Extreme" difficulty adds adversarial patterns

### 2. Insufficient Model Capacity
- 27M parameters may be too small for 9x9 complexity
- 6x6 needed 20M for perfect accuracy
- 9x9 might need 50-100M parameters

### 3. Training Data Quality
- "Extreme" puzzles are intentionally difficult
- May contain patterns that confuse learning
- Model might benefit from curriculum (easy â†’ hard)

### 4. Architecture Limitations
- 8 ACT steps insufficient for complex reasoning chains
- Balanced config (512 hidden) may be too small
- Need deeper reasoning capability

## Failure Modes

1. **Cannot maintain constraints** - violates uniqueness rules
2. **No error recovery** - wrong predictions persist
3. **Poor generalization** - 7% train/test gap suggests overfitting
4. **Incomplete learning** - only partially understands Sudoku rules

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Train on easier puzzles first** - build up from simple to extreme
2. **Increase model size** - try full HRM config (not balanced)
3. **More ACT steps** - allow 16 steps for complex reasoning
4. **Curriculum learning** - start with partially solved puzzles

### Architecture Changes
1. **Explicit constraint layers** - enforce uniqueness rules
2. **Separate validation network** - check constraint violations
3. **Iterative refinement** - train to fix errors progressively
4. **Attention visualization** - understand what model focuses on

### Training Strategy
```bash
# Recommended approach for better 9x9 performance
1. Generate mixed difficulty dataset (easy + medium + hard)
2. Use larger model (full HRM, not balanced)
3. Train with curriculum (200 epochs easy, 200 medium, 200 hard)
4. Add constraint loss term to penalize violations
```

## Conclusion

The 9x9 attempt demonstrates that HRM struggles with full-complexity Sudoku when:
- Trained only on extreme difficulty puzzles
- Using balanced (smaller) configuration
- Without curriculum learning

The 63% accuracy shows partial learning but fundamental issues with:
- Understanding global constraints
- Maintaining consistency across predictions
- Refining solutions iteratively

This suggests 9x9 Sudoku requires either:
1. Significantly larger models (50M+ parameters)
2. Specialized architectures with constraint enforcement
3. Curriculum learning from easier puzzles
4. Or combination of all three

The model has learned something (better than random 11% baseline) but falls far short of the reliable solving achieved on 4x4 and 6x6 puzzles.
